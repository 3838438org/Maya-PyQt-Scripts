Scripts to easily build PyQt for Maya


## Maya 2014
Maya 2014 is shipping with PySide, therefore there is no more need to build PySide.

libxml, openSSL, OpenAL, python2.7, qt-4.8.2-64, and tbb are also coming by default in the Maya include and lib folder, so unless you have a very 
specific need, you would not need to rebuild any of those libraries like before.

You can find more explanations about building PyQt and PySide and instructions about using these scripts on the blog at:

You can find the scripts used for building Qt, PyQt and PySide for Maya 2013.5, [here](https://github.com/cyrillef/Maya-PyQt-Scripts/releases/tag/v2013.5).
The windows scripts get updated for Maya 2013-5. They are similar to the Maya 2013 procedures and instructions, but you do not need to rebuild openssl this time.
