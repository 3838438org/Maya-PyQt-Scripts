# Maya-PyQt-Scripts
Scripts to easily build PyQt for Maya


## Maya 2013-5
The windows scripts get updated for Maya 2013-5. They are similar to the Maya 2013 procedures and instructions, but you do not need to rebuild openssl this time.


## Maya 2013
You can find the scripts used for building Qt, PyQt and PySide for Maya 2013, [here](https://github.com/cyrillef/Maya-PyQt-Scripts/releases/tag/v2013.0).
You can find more explanations about building PyQt and PySide and instructions about using these scripts on the blog at:
